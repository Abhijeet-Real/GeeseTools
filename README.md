```

##  Installation


```bash
pip install GeeseTools
```

---

## 📚 How to Use

### 1. Import the modules

```python
from datapreprocessor import datapreprocessor as dpp
from utils import train_model as tm
from utils import evaluate_model as eval
from utils import plot
```

---

### 2. Preprocess your data

```python
# Creating object for DataPreProcessor Class
obj = dpp(pd.read_csv("heart.csv"), target="diagnosis")
```

---

### 3. Train a model

```python
model, task_type, history = tm.train_model(X_train, y_train)
```

---

### 4. Evaluate the model

```python
metric, y_pred = eval.evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test, task_type)
```

---

### 5. Plot results

```python
plot.plot_model_outputs(y_test, y_pred) # for Classification problem
or
plot.plot_model_outputs(history) # for Regression problem

```
